					<h3>How do you want you and your work to be perceived?</h3>

					<p>First and foremost, I am a prose writer. I have always been most comfortable creating with words. I have very little experience with visual communication, but I am confident that I can become at least competent with such compositions. I have been told, as a Technical Communication major, that a working knowledge of visual communication design combined with good writing skills is very welcome in many sectors.</p>

					<h3>What visual elements will work? What will not work?</h3>

					<p>Please refer to my collage for my favorite visual elements that are likely to find their way into my work. My favorite themes include science fiction and, to a lesser degree, fantasy. I am also a bit of an Anglophile; therefore I am drawn to Victorian gardens and everything associated with high tea.
						Since I prefer organic (if imaginary) elements, anything geometric would not fit in with my style. I know what you're thinking! Yes, spaceships are absolutely organic elements, in my book. This lies at the heart of why I am such a fan of Joss Whedon's short-lived "Firefly" series. The ship, Serenity, was just as much a living character as any of the humans which occupied her interior.</p>

					<h3>What kind of content will you have: e.g. code samples, logos, essays, etc.</h3>

					<p>I could show some examples of work that I have done here at EWU, but to be honest, a Technical Communication major's work is precise and practical, but not very entertaining. I have two essays that I wrote for Intercultural Communications class that may be satisfactory. I may also include an original short story or excerpt.</p>
